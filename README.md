> ## Some of data projects which tackle different business problems across various domains.

## [**Project 1- Customer segmentation**](https://github.com/egtef/customer-segmentation)
### Overview
•	Used dataset of appliance and electronic online store to segment the customers based on their recency, frequency and monetary.

•	Implement EDA using Python to group the customers into segments using RFM analysis. 

•	Apply K-means clustering algorithm, identifying the optimum number of clustering.

•	Evaluate the model using silhouette score getting elbow at k=2, score=0.77.
